abstract = {A variety of observations of intense, long-lived oceanic vortices are interpreted as examples of a distinct phenomenon, which is given the name Submesoscale, Coherent Vortices (SCV's). The distinguishing characteristics of SCV's are defined and illustrated by example, and a survey is made of the different SCV types presently known. On the basis of extant theoretical and modeling solutions, interpretations are made of the dynamics associated with SCV existence, movement, endurance, interactions with other currents, generation, and contributions to the transport of chemical properties in the ocean.},
